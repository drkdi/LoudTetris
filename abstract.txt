## LoudTetris
*like tetris, but loud*

# Background
Loud tetris is a spinoff of the classic tetris game, where continuous falling objects of different shapes need to be arranged in a specific manner to clear the line
The twist is that, as a possible input, the pieces can be controlled voice commands (in addition to keyboard and mouse commands).

# Functionality & MVP
With this version of tetris, much like regular versions of tetris, users will have to:

* Have a blank canvas upon loading
* Start the game by pressing a key
* Have the blocks automatically drop, and move them left and right
* Be able to rotate the blocks
* As a bonus, the ability to only have input voice commands in place of the left and right

# Sample Code

 Using the following code, the object created by the WebSpeechAPI is parsed and converted into a string for a command.
```js
   for (let i = event.resultIndex, len = event.results.length; i < len; i++) {
      let transcript = event.results[i][0].transcript;
      if ( event.results[i].isFinal === false) {
         event.results[i][0].transcript = "";
         transcript = transcript.split(" ");
         transcript.forEach( function(word) {
            words.push(word.toLowerCase());
            words = words.map(str => str.replace(/\s/g, '')).filter(function (word) { return word; });
            words = Array.from(new Set(words));
         })
      }
   }
```

Having to use the intermittent results because the full result takes too long to return, sometimes the same result (e.g. "left) is returned twice, thus, by using a throttle all those interpolations are allowed to be compiled and parsed, preserving the original function.

```js
 recognition.onresult = throttle(function (event) {
   parseSpeech(event);
}, 1000);
```
 



# Wireframes
The general layout will be a large rectangular canvas centered on the screen, with a description/controls on the right, as well as links to my github/personal site/linkedin.

# Architecture and Technologies
* Javascript and HTML5 will serve as the base foundation for the game rendering and mechanics, and using CSS to style the page itself. 
* Web Audio API will be used for background music and control
* An external JS library will be used to convert voice to inputs.

# Implementation Timeline
 (tentative)
Day 1: Research and implement canvas for a properly formatted playing field

Day 2: Implement block shapes and figure out actions

Day 3: Figure out collisions and combining objects with playing field

Day 4+: Implement voice API
